# AI-Based Automated Answer Sheet Evaluation System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on evaluating student answer sheets automatically using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The system analyzes students’ answers, compares them with model answers, and assigns marks based on semantic similarity, keyword matching, and relevance. This reduces manual effort and ensures faster and unbiased evaluation.

## Problem Statement
Manual evaluation of answer sheets is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human bias. With an increasing number of students, traditional evaluation methods become inefficient. There is a need for an **automated answer evaluation system** that can accurately and fairly assess descriptive answers using AI techniques.

## Objectives
- Automatically evaluate descriptive answers  
- Compare student answers with model answers  
- Assign marks based on content similarity  
- Provide fast and unbiased evaluation  
- Reduce workload of teachers  
- Develop a simple web-based interface  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Streamlit** (Web Interface)
- **NLTK** (Text Processing)
- **Scikit-learn** (TF-IDF & Similarity)
- **Pandas** (Data Management)

---

## Applications
- Schools and colleges  
- Online examinations  
- Practice tests and assessments  

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how AI and NLP can be effectively used to automate the evaluation of descriptive answer sheets, ensuring accuracy, fairness, and efficiency in the assessment process.
