 AI-Based Automated Answer Sheet Evaluation System
Project Overview

This project focuses on evaluating student answer sheets automatically using Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes students’ answers, compares them with model answers, and assigns marks based on semantic similarity, keyword matching, and relevance. This reduces manual effort and ensures faster and unbiased evaluation.

Problem Statement

Manual evaluation of answer sheets is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human bias. With increasing numbers of students, traditional evaluation methods are inefficient. There is a need for an automated answer evaluation system that can accurately and fairly assess descriptive answers using AI.
